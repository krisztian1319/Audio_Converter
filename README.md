# Audio_Converter
This is an old senior project that takes JSON data and creates an audio-based prototype that manipulates audio based on the data.
Specifically, it creates a continuous long-form soundwave that is meant to be played during exercise that depicts the heart rate and 
breathing rate where the pitch and gain are louder with more erratic and frequent breathing and heart rates. The JSON data is false but
based off of real data compiled from scientific sources.
